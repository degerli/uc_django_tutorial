# Uploadcare Django tutorial

**This is a simple [Uploadcare][1] Django tutorial in the form of `git` repository. Read on!**

Each commit in the repository is a step of the tutorial.
Take a look at [the diff between `pre-uploadcare` and `master`][2] to see
only the commits related to Uploadcare
([prior to them][3], a simple Django project is created).
